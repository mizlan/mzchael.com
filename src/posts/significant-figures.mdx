When I was taking chemistry classes in 10th grade of high school, I wanted a
way to calculate expressions involving significant figures--not merely
calculating how many significant figures an expression had, but actually
reducing expressions according to the (confusing) rules of significant figures.
That project of mine began in late 2019 when I barely knew any Python.

I had then made a [recursive descent
parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) completely from
scratch without doing any reading, and it actually worked okay (the actual code
is now private for good reason). But I hit a roadblock when it came to the
number 0. I didn't know how to treat 0 in terms of its significant figures and
interactions with other terms, and the younger me gave up.

Three years later, armed with much more programming experience and knowledge of
more paradigms, languages, and tooling, I have finally written a working
version of it. It's written in Haskell and hosted
[here](https://github.com/mizlan/significant-figures/).

And while Heroku's free tier still exists ([it's going away soon](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq)), there is a
web version [here](significant-figures.herokuapp.com/). The HTML, JS _and_ CSS are all written in Haskell using DSLs. :)

Its implementation uses, among many other things:

- the parser combinator library [parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.15.1) for elegant LL(1) parsing
- the property testing library [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck-2.14.2/) for generating arbitrary tests

and supports a **WHOLE LOTTA STUFF** you'd want to do with sigfigs! Check it out.

As far as I can tell, it is the
**only program of its kind**. Have fun with it, try to break it, and if you do
please report an issue! :)
